# Text-to-Speech
The Text-to-Speech Python project using Tkinter with a GUI allows users to input text and convert it into speech. It features an intuitive interface where users can type or paste text, choose voice options, and listen to the spoken output, providing a practical and interactive way to convert written content into audio.
